## Hi everyone!  
In this project I aim to expand my SQL skills.  
The first commited file is written with Alex The Analyst online course. 
It is the first part of exploration, where we looked at some general information to understand the dataset and extract crucial information. Some concepts used there are temporary tables, CTE's and a view.  
Every other file is my work, where I try to dig deeper within the dataset.   
As I am also learning how to use Power BI for data visualization I decided to go this route, preparing multiple views for efficient picturing of this data.  
My aim is to prepare data for a dashboard, which I will add as soon as it is finished.  

Data source: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths  
Environment: SQL Server Management Studio
