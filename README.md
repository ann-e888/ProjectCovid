# Project: SQL Data Exploration and Visualization
## Overview
This project aims to enhance SQL skills by exploring and analyzing COVID-19 data sourced from Our World in Data. The primary focus is on understanding the dataset, extracting crucial information, and preparing the data for visualization using Power BI.
## Structure
The first commited file is written with Alex The Analyst online course. 
It is the first part of exploration, where we looked at some general information to understand the dataset and extract crucial information. Some concepts used there are temporary tables, CTE's and a view.  
Every other file is my work, where I try to dig deeper within the dataset.
##Visualization
As I am also learning how to use Power BI for data visualization I decided to go this route, preparing multiple views for efficient picturing of this data.  
My aim is to prepare data for a dashboard, which I will add as soon as it is finished.  
## Data Source
**Data source:** [Our World in Data - COVID Deaths](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths)
## Environment
I'm utilizing SQL Server Management Studio for my SQL work.
